            <p>In this project, I am trying to research and explore how to transfer encrypted messages. The encryption idea is originally from my censorship domain and also inspired by the film, Citizen Four. In that movie, Edward Snowden asked people to do certain steps to decode encrypted emails. He will get mad if people donâ€™t do it.<br><br>

            I the case I used is a Dota 2 Youtuber, Chi-Long Qua, who was really famous and active a few years ago. However, because he swore a lot publicly on the Internet, Youtube asked him to take down all his video and delete his original youtube channel. I used his voices from his original video, and reinterpret by encrypting these comments by morse code, filter, enigma encryption.<br><br>

            The idea I am trying to express here is that I want to show people how can you encrypt your information in order to enhance your privacy. However, if everyone is going to do this way, it is going to be a very painful world, since there is nobody you can trust.</p>
